<p class='text-muted', style='font-size:17px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right:10px;'>
<span style='color: #555555'><strong>Abstract:</strong></span> This article is an exploration of several databases from diverse bodies, aiming to understand the unprecedented challenge our society is currently facing. Basing in the insights from information gathered via databases to comprehend what is the right approach is to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. 
</p>

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> Introduction </h5>
 <p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    <span style='font-style: italic;'>“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”</span> Sherlock Holmes.<br>
	To understand the context of this article it is relevant to understand what the definition of a pandemic is: <span style='font-style: italic;'>“an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.”</span> Throughout history we have  experienced several pandemics, among those the Spanish Flu<span style='font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;'>(H1N1),</span> that being the most severe in modern society, affecting 1/3 of the worldwide population, it is estimated that between 50-100 million deaths occurred, with a mortality rate of approximately 2.8%. Currently society is facing a new pandemic namely Covid-19<span style='font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;'>(SARS-CoV-2)</span> as the numbers thus far has shown it has affected 0.4% of the worldwide population, with around 895 thousand deaths, with a mortality rate of approximately 0.011%. Inevitably there will be a considerable amount of similarities among pandemics,  intriguingly the age groups affected by those two pandemics diverse fiercely, while the Spanish Flu  hit harder in the age group between 20-40 years old, Covid-19 most affected the elderly group that accounts for people over 65 years old. This article also will explore the similarities and differences among other pandemics that have occurred in the past two centuries for comparison. <br>
	In order to understand better the implications caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and which would be the right approach to this challenge society is currently facing, this article will focus in two countries that have had different approaches toward the Covid-19 pandemic as the implications socioeconomic caused by it.

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> Hygiene </h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    Prior to analyse the two countries and further pandemics it is important to comprehend  that hygiene is a key factor in the fighting against the spread of diseases; first lets comprehend the recent historical context of hygiene. The term hygiene comes from Hygeia the Greek goddess of health, the definition of hygiene is: <span style='font-style: italic;'>“conditions or practices conducive to maintaining health and preventing disease, especially through cleanliness.”</span>, by definition hygiene and health are strictly correlated, based on these premises is relevant to salient that the attempt for better hygiene conditions is dated back from around 2800 B.C. with evidences of the Babylonians making soap, though just by 1964  with the advance of scientific knowledge  the creation of antibacterial liquid soaps was possible, which become one of the major agents used against the spread of diseases, as it is currently one of the key agents against the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet only post Industrial Revolution hygiene and sanitation became a serious governmental matter with installations of health guidelines as the population growth increased significantly due rapid urbanization of villages and towns, that gradually were turning into vast cities, that consequently brought outbreaks of epidemics such as cholera and typhoid, those that easily spread through poor sanitation conditions.<br>
	These health guidelines became a worldwide concerned after society undergo two great world wars and a great depression, with the creation of the World Health Organization<span style='font-style: italic;'>(WHO)</span>  in 1948 aiming to unify efforts to prevent outbreaks, along with several other bodies yet to come.
</p>

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> Modern Pandemics </h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Mortality rate:</span> It is correlation between population and number of deaths. As the worldwide population has grown 5.1 times since 1889 the comparison between the Russian Flu and the Covid-19 will have a significant difference in the mortality rate outcomes, despite the number of deaths closed matched. Undeniably the advantage of science has level this discrepancy considerably.<br>
    <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Infected:</span> it is the portion of the population infected by the disease. The charts show the minimum and maximum estimation of people infected in the pandemics from different bodies.<br>
    <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Subtype:</span> Viruses are divided into subtypes based on the proteins on their surface. Influenza virus family has two proteins on its surface H and N, each containing numerous variations, what allows many combinations that creates a large range of subtypes, therefore hampering the efficiency of vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the large coronavirus family, there are hundreds of coronavirus circulating among animals and humans, though only three types can be more severe or lethal to humans among those the SARS subtype.<br>
    <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>R<sub>0</sub>:</span> is the metric used to describe how contagious are the infectious agent. More on the subject briefly.<br>
    The analyses have shown that despite all the commotion the Covid-19 pandemic has not being as severe as most of the previous pandemics, with a mortality rate only twice as bigger than the typical seasonal flu and infecting thus far only 0.4% of the worldwide population, while the typical seasonal flu will infect from 0.5 billion to 1 billion yearly which comprises approximately 4.2%-11.4% of the worldwide population.  Diseases also have a fatality rate which would be the correlation between number of infected people and deaths, nevertheless the numbers are a rough estimation as a short portion of the population is tested which consequently prone to measurement errors, therefore it will not be stressed in this article.

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'>Transmissibility (R<sub>0</sub>)</h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    Transmissibility ratio or Basic Reproduction Number R<sub>0</sub> is based in a complex mathematical model that is affected by various factors such as biological, sociobehavioral and environmental, it will appoint the transmissibility ratio spread of the infection. Due its complexity R<sub>0</sub>  can be easily misrepresented, mostly it will provide a satisfactory indicator of how severe and how fast the infection can spread on average in an uniform population.
    R<sub>0</sub> will usually have two values a low and a high, for instance the R<sub>0</sub> for Covid-19 has a low of 1.4 to a high of 3.9, which implies that a person can contaminate from 1.4 people to 3.9 people depending on various factors, recurrently an average of the two values will be used, in this case an infected person with Covid-19 can infect 2.65 other people. If the average R<sub>0</sub> is greater than 1 the infection will spread exponentially, otherwise it will spread slowly and locally<span style='font-style: italic;'>(epidemic). </span><br>
    The chart also provides an interesting insight, comparatively the typical seasonal flu infects on average 750 million people worldwide yearly, while the swine flu pandemic in a nineteen months period infected around 0.7 billion to 1.4 billion still they have a lower mortality rate than the Covid-19 that has infected thus far in a ten months period 31 million people worldwide, alone one could draw conclusions that the measures imposed around the world had been a key factor to contain the proliferation of the virus SARS-Cov-2, yet we could be falling in the initial quote of this article <span style='font-style: italic;'>“... Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories…” </span>, there are other variables to be considered.<br>

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'>Incubation Period</h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    It’s the interval between a person been infected to when symptoms first appear. This interval varies from virus to virus as from individual to individual, consequently the measurements will have a minimum and maximum range with occasionally outliners. Acknowledging the incubation period of  a virus can provide relevant information such as severity of the virus as the period required for quarantine. The incubation period of a virus is also an important factor in the results of the R<sub>0</sub>.<br>
    Below a chart with the incubation period of the typical seasonal flu, the swine flu and the Covid-19 pandemics. Initially the  quarantine for Covid-19 was 14 days, since September of 2020 several countries in Europe and worldwide are adhering a 10 days quarantine, perhaps with the ongoing acquisition of new data new insights are emerging to help understand better the virus SARS-Cov-2. <br>
</p><br><br>


<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'>Age Groups</h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    Interpret the data to identify the most susceptible age groups in an outbreak collaborates to  determinate strategically which, where and how the measures against the outbreak should be implemented. While looking at a pandemic from an age group perspective it is mostly expected that it will have a higher mortality rate among the most vulnerable groups the elderly and the infants which creates an U-Shaped curve,  this article compared the age distribution for hospitalization and mortality rate in percentage for Swine Flu, Covid-19 and Seasonal Flu pandemics based on data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention<span style='font-style: italic;'>(CDC)</span>  in the United States of America and an additional data for the Spanish Flu’s mortality rate by age groups from Madrid’s medical records at the time. Note that the number of infected people is not very representative as a big portion of the population will be asymptomatic<span style='font-style: italic;'>(presenting no symptoms)</span>, additionally a small portion of the population will take the tests, consequently the estimation of infected people is somehow unreliable.<br>
<span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Hospitalization:</span>  Only a certain amount of the infected people will require medical attention, for instance approximately 20% of the Covid-19’s positive cases will require hospitalization, while it is estimated that around 1.4% will be hospitalize from the seasonal flu pandemic which is around 0.16% of the worldwide population requiring hospitalization yearly, while Covid-19 thus far infected around 0.5% of the worldwide population, which consists of 0.1% of the worldwide population requiring hospitalization, considering the 1/5 hospitalization rate mentioned above.<br>
The hospitalization chart demonstrates a very distinct behavior from the swine flu compared to the other two pandemics, being it to some degree homogeneously distributed throughout the age groups, with 34.03% of the hospitalizations  in the age group between 5-24 years old the most affected by it and the least affected the age group 65<sub>(+)</sub>  years old, at meanwhile the Covid-19 and the seasonal flu pandemics follow a similar pattern with the age group 65<sub>(+)</sub>  years old the most affected with 39.94% and 57% respectively, Covid-19 pandemic with the least affected age group being the 0-4 years old with only 0.61% of its patients hospitalized, while the seasonal flu with the least affected age group being the 5-24 years old with 4.3% of its patients hospitalized.<br>
<span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Deaths:</span>  The number of deaths caused by a pandemic also can be distributed by age group, the death chart reiterates the similarities between Covid-19 and seasonal flu pandemics with both following similar patterns throughout all age groups which culminates with the age group  65<sub>(+)</sub>  years old the most affected with 78.45% and 74.8% respectively, with the groups under 24 years old comprising less than 0.25% of the deaths for Covid-19 pandemic and 1.4% for seasonal flu pandemic, while the swine flu pandemic having its most affected age group between 5-24 years old comprising 54.03% of the deaths, the age group between 0-4 years old being the least affected with 1.41% of the deaths.<br>
The individuals charts demonstrate the hospitalization distribution and the percentage of deaths based on the hospitalization data, here it is visible how the seasonal flu and Covid-19 pandemics have similar distribution for both variables, while the swine flu pandemic pended toward the opposite groups for instance the age group between 5-24 years old comprises 34.03% of the hospitalization for the swine flu pandemic which 54.03% of these hospitalized patients died, in the other hand the Covid-19 and seasonal flu pandemics will have their risk age group in the 65<sub>(+)</sub> years old with 78.45% deaths from 39.94% of the hospitalized patients and 74.8% deaths from 57% of the hospitalized patients respectively, a high mortality rate for the elderly group.<br>

<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    The line chart for deaths with the addition of the Spanish Flu pandemic demonstrates how it mostly affected the age groups under 50 years old with 1/3 of the deaths in the age group between 25-49 years, the swine flu pandemic also had a higher emphasis in the young population being over half of the deaths in the age group between 5-24 years old, contrarily the other two pandemics have a very strong correlation as both of them with approximately 3/4 of the deaths in the age group  65<sub>(+)</sub> years old, in another words the elderly population .<br>
    Fundamentally correlation is the statistical relationship between two or more variables moving in a parallel that is measured by the variations between the data points, this relationship can be negative<span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>(-1)</span> different direction, or positive<span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>(+1)</span> same direction,  where the strength of this correlation been determined by how close the coefficient is from -1 or 1, if the coefficient is 0 or close to it is considered a week correlation. The Correlation Matrix chart reinforces the strong correlation between the Covid-19 and the seasonal flu pandemics in both hospitalization and deaths rates with the swine flu pandemic sharing a negative correlation with the other two pandemics with a considerable strength for the hospitalization variable. The Spanish flu pandemic shares weak correlations with the other pandemics deaths rates.<br>
