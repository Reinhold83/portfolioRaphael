<p class='text-muted', style='font-size:17px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right:10px;'>
<span style='color: #555555'><strong>Abstract:</strong></span>This article is an exploration of several databases from diverse bodies, aiming to understand the unprecedented challenge our society is currently facing. Basing in the insights from information gathered via databases to comprehend what is the right approach is to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. 
</p>

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> Introduction </h5>
 <p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'><span style='font-style: italic;'>“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”</span> Sherlock Holmes.<br>
	To understand the context of this article it is relevant to understand what the definition of a pandemic is: <span style='font-style: italic;'>“an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.”</span> Throughout history we have  experienced several pandemics, among those the Spanish Flu<span style='font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;'>(H1N1),</span> that being the most severe in modern society, affecting 1/3 of the worldwide population, it is estimated that between 50-100 million deaths occurred, with a mortality rate of approximately 2.8%. Currently society is facing a new pandemic namely Covid-19<span style='font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;'>(SARS-CoV-2)</span> as the numbers thus far has shown it has affected 0.36% of the worldwide population, with around 895 thousand deaths, with a mortality rate of approximately 0.011%. Inevitably there will be a considerable amount of similarities among pandemics,  intriguingly the age groups affected by those two pandemics diverse fiercely, while the Spanish Flu  hit harder in the age group between 20-40 years old, Covid-19 most affected the elderly group that accounts for people over 65 years old. This article also will explore the similarities and differences among other pandemics that have occurred in the past two centuries for comparison. <br>
    In order to understand better the implications caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and which would be the right approach to this challenge society is currently facing, this article will focus in two countries that have had different approaches toward the Covid-19 pandemic. Also the implications socioeconomic caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> Hygiene </h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>Prior to analyse the two countries and further pandemics it is important to comprehend  that hygiene is a key factor in the fighting against the spread of diseases; first lets comprehend the recent historical context of hygiene. The term hygiene comes from Hygeia the Greek goddess of health, by definition hygiene is: <span style='font-style: italic;'>“conditions or practices conducive to maintaining health and preventing disease, especially through cleanliness.”</span>, by definition hygiene and health are strictly correlated, based on these premises is relevant to salient that the attempt for better hygiene conditions is dated back from around 2800 B.C. with evidences of the Babylonians making soap, though just by 1964  with the advance of scientific knowledge  the creation of antibacterial liquid soaps was possible, which become one of the major agents used against the spread of diseases, as it is currently one of the key agents against the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet only post Industrial Revolution hygiene and sanitation became a serious governmental matter with installations of health guidelines as the population growth increased significantly due rapid urbanization of villages and towns, that gradually were turning into vast cities, that consequently brought outbreaks of epidemics such as cholera and typhoid, those that easily spread through poor sanitation conditions.<br>
	These health guidelines became a worldwide concerned over a century later after society undergo two great world wars and a great depression, with the creation of the World Health Organization<span style='font-style: italic;'>(WHO)</span>  in 1948 aiming to unify efforts to prevent outbreaks, along with several other bodies yet to come.

<h5 style='margin: 7px; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> Recent Pandemics </h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Mortality rate:</span> It is correlation between population and number of deaths. As the worldwide population has grown 5.1 times since 1889 the comparison between the Russian Flu and the Covid-19 will have a significant difference in the mortality rate outcomes, despite the number of deaths closed matched. Undeniably the advantage of science has level this discrepancy considerably.<br>
    <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Infected:</span> it is the portion of the population infected by the disease. The charts show the minimum and maximum estimation of people infected in the pandemics from different bodies.<br>
    <span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;'>Subtype:</span> Viruses are divided into subtypes based on the proteins on the exterior of the virus. Influenza has two proteins on its exterior H and N, each containing numerous variations, what allows many combinations that creates a large range of subtypes, therefore hampering the efficiency of vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the large coronavirus family, there are hundreds of coronavirus circulating among animals and humans, though only three types can be more severe or lethal to humans among those the SARS subtype.

<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    The analyses have shown that despite all the commotion the Covid-19 pandemic has not being as severe as most of the previous pandemics, with a mortality rate only twice as bigger than the typical seasonal flu and infecting thus far only 0.36% of the worldwide population, while the typical seasonal flu will infect from 0.5 billion to 1 billion yearly which comprises approximately 4.2%-11.4% of the worldwide population.
